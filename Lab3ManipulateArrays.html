        document.querySelector("callback-btn") // in this line we are defining this command "document.querySelector" for the computer to match the first element with the indicated selector for them for us to use it in the following part of the code which is gonna be the addEventListener
            addEventListener("click", function(){ //In this part of the code we are using the method addEventListener in order for us to tell the computer what to do once the event "click happens" and then we are creating the anonymous function taht we are gonna run once the event "click" is triggered 
                console.log("User has clicked the button!");// this anonymous function as we can see just are telling the machine to display the message "User has clicked the button"
